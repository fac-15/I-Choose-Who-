**Testing**

**Accessibility**
- We definitely let our accessibility fall by the wayside. We deployed with a whopping Lighthouse score of 22. Problems included: **no labels** attached to our input field; **no alt** attributes on img elements; no **title** in the head.

- Placeholder text is automatically greyed out... which is a good design convention. However, this came through as an accessibility issue - poor colour contrast between grey text and white input field. 

- We managed to resolve all this however, and get our audit score up to 100!

- Better CSS
- Display more info about each Pokemon
- Refactor our handlers.js file. Our ```handleHomeRoute```, ```handlePublic``` and ```handleJSON``` functions all shared a lot of similar code.
