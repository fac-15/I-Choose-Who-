### Problems üò• 
![travolta](https://media.giphy.com/media/yuI7fL5cR1YeA/giphy.gif)

- Testing

- Accessibility
-- We definitely let our accessibility fall by the wayside. We deployed with a whopping Lighthouse score of 22. Problems included: no labels attached to our input field; no alt attributes on img elements; no title in the head.

-- Placeholder text is automatically greyed out... which is a good design convention. However, this came through as an accessibility issue - poor colour contrast between grey text and white input field. 

-- We managed to resolve all this and get our audit score up to 100.

### Refactoring



### **Tests** 

- We had problems testing, we managed to test nothing!
